# NewsLetter-Signup
## A webpage that collects user information like email ID using the MAILCHIMP API, and sign them up for a weekly NewsLetter.

* This webpage is designed using basic frontend techniques like bootstrap and it demonstrates the use of MailChimp API which helps in collecting the required user information.
* The information entered on the webpage is posted to the Mailchimp servers using a post request in the index.js file.
* I have used Node JS, along with various other modules like 'express', 'body-parser' and 'https'.
* The application of all these modules can be found in the index.js file.
